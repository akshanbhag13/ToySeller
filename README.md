# ToySeller
This program uses user inputs to create an idea for a custom-made toy.
It does this by asking the user to choose one of three options. Then, an if statement runs and based on whatever the user has chosen, asks whether the user wants to customize the toy even more.
Based on what the user chooses, the cost of the toy is updated and then the final cost is printed out at the end.
